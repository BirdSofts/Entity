# Getting Started
1.	Installation process:
Currently hanging around somewhere within compile and creation! :)

2.	Software dependencies:
Dependent on Qt/QML API's

3.	Latest releases:
Still no release, just coding and debugging

4.	API references:
Online Qt Reference

# Build and Test
If you are a beginner, Qt Creator is your choice, if not you probably know what you are doing.
It is possible to use both Visual Studio and Qt Creator IDEs, but make sure configuring them correctly.

Compilable using CMake.
```cmake
cmake --build build-path
```
